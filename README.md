About
============

This page provides information about the project developed at Mesbah lab, UC Berkeley, USA, called ["Low-cost electronics for controlling current and power
in DC plasma reactor."](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/plasma.html)  Experiments were carried out in practice at Mesbah laboratory, and the data contained in this GitHub repository were collected in those experiments.

**Please check more details about this project on the page detailing the ["(link soon)"](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/plasma.html)**


`mainMatlab.m` is a MATLAB(R) script that shows the experimental data. The script also generates the corresponding figures. More data is available to download, but they are not shown in the figures. Yet all data are free for download in this repo.

`arduino_due_UC_Berkeley_power_plasma_dynamics_open_loop.ino` is an Arduino Due code. This code processes data that were collected in real-time. Experiments: controlling the current flowing through the plasma reactor. 

`arduino_due_UC_Berkeley_power_plasma_PI_control.ino` is an Arduino Due code. This code processes data that were collected in real-time. Experiments: controlling the power in the plasma reactor. 

All code, schematics, and data are available in this repository.

For more details about the experimental data and the corresponding academic publications, please visit [the project page](http://www.anvargas.com/blog).


Installation
============

1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) on your computer.
2. Add the folders `code/` and `data/` to your path in MATLAB/Octave: e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in MATLAB, or 
    - by running the `addpath` function from your command window or `startup` script.

Make sure that you are running Matlab 2017a (or a newer version). Older versions may work, but it is uncertain.

3. Upload the code `arduino_due_UC_Berkeley_power_plasma_dynamics_open_loop.ino` or `arduino_due_UC_Berkeley_power_plasma_PI_control.ino`  on your Arduino Due using the corresponding IDE interface.

Usage
=====

Typical usage of `mainCodeMatlab.m` consists of running it in your MATLAB. The code generates figures.

MATLAB
------
  1. Run `mainMatlab.m`.
